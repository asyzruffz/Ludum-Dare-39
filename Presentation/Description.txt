We are running out of power! It is up to you to turn on the power back. It is simple, just turn it on and no manual needed 
for this situation (Sorry, I just lost it somewhere). Just with one, two, three, errr...Just hit em with all you got.
You can hit the switch, smash the button, turn on the lever or just unplug and plug the socket back again to get the power 
on before city completely run out of power. The choice is yours to decide. After all, you must find out yourself. 
The city is depending on you. Goodluck!
